Requirements and Step
Createa Terraform script that bootstrap a 3 nodes OpenShift clusters on Vagrant
Setup a OpenEDX application in a kuberenete cluster that is deployed on the OpenShift cluster
Create a gitlab CI/CD pipeline that commits to openEdx source code is automatically deployed to the cluster using FluxCD
1. Terraform and OpenShift:
Write a Terraform script that sets up a 3-node OpenShift cluster on Vagrant. The script should configure the necessary virtual machines, networking, and OpenShift components.
Demonstrate the deployment of the OpenShift cluster using the Terraform script.
Explain the key components of an OpenShift cluster and their roles.
2. OpenEDX Application in Kubernetes:
Set up a Kubernetes cluster on the OpenShift cluster created in the previous step.
Deploy an OpenEDX application on the Kubernetes cluster. This should include setting up the necessary pods, services, and any required persistent storage.
Test the application to ensure it is running correctly on the Kubernetes cluster.
3. GitLab CI/CD Pipeline with FluxCD:
Create a GitLab repository for an OpenEDX application's source code.
Set up a GitLab CI/CD pipeline that triggers on commits to the OpenEDX source code repository.
Configure the pipeline to automatically deploy the updated code to the OpenShift cluster using FluxCD, a GitOps tool.
Demonstrate the pipeline in action by making a change to the OpenEDX source code and observing the automatic deployment to the OpenShift cluster.
